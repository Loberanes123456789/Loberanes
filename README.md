# Loberanes, Jay Lord

 I studied basic programming at PHINMA-Cagayan de Oro College Puerto Campus over 2 years during my Senior High school ,

 I have no idea what is programming that time and encountered lot of difficulties and failure projects, but I didn't stop. I work so hard and continuously learning more about programing.

 I've been studying web develop because I found It's Challenging and there are Opportunities Anywhere in the World if I pursue this course.

 I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with architecture and project management.
